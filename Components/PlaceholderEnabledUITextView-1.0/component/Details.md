A `UITextView` extension to support placeholders on editable `UITextView` instances. 

`UITextField` has support for placeholders but `UITextView` (sadly) does not, meaning you often have to write custom code to get support for placeholders. No more. This Xamarin component is intended to save you those 15 minutes of scouring StackOverflow and converting a code snippet from Objective-C to C# so you can be doing something better.
